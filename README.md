CS229 - Project - Predicting Lung Function Decline
The goal of this project is to predict a patientâ€™s rate of decline in lung function. Input to our algorithm includes patient clinical information including patient age, gender, FVC count, percent and smoking status stored in a CSV file and lung CT scan image slices in the dicom format. We aim to predict  the FVC value along with its confidence interval associated with each week as the output. The evaluation metric of this project is a modified version of Laplace Log Likelihood.
